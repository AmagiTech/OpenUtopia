# Ethics Statement

This project is intended to promote ethical, democratic, and human-centered systems.

It must not be used to:

- Support authoritarian regimes  
- Build surveillance-based control systems  
- Justify discrimination, racism, or suppression of minorities  
- Develop closed-source derivatives aimed at monopolizing power or access

This is a framework meant for open, equitable societies. Any use in conflict with these principles is a violation of the projectâ€™s intent, even if technically allowed.
