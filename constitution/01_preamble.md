# Article 1 – Nature and Vision of the System

**OpenUtopia** is an open-source social contract, written by the people and for the people.

Its core mission is to establish a societal structure based on:

- **Freedom**
- **Ethics**
- **Transparency**
- **Scientific Reasoning**

Power is balanced through public participation.  
Representation is based on merit, not popularity.  
Governance must be accountable, adaptable, and inclusive.

OpenUtopia is not merely a model of governance —  
it is a **culture**, a **collective responsibility**, and a **shared consciousness of global citizenship**.
