# Article 2 â€“ Citizenship and Global Responsibility

Every person born into, accepted by, or actively contributing to the OpenUtopia system is recognized as a **Citizen**.

Citizenship in OpenUtopia is dual in nature:

1. **National Responsibility**:  
   Citizens participate in local governance, contribute to public welfare, and uphold the shared values of their community.

2. **Global Responsibility**:  
   Each citizen is also a **World Citizen**, responsible for ecological sustainability, intercultural respect, and global solidarity.

Citizenship is not a passive status, but an active and ethical commitment.

The rights and responsibilities of citizenship may not be revoked without due process based on public accountability and ethical review.

A citizen may belong to any culture, faith, identity, or ideology,  
so long as they act in accordance with the shared ethical principles of OpenUtopia.

The system protects diversity not as an exception, but as a foundation of unity.
